# m6A-Suite

## Project Summary
N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA methylation in mammalian cells and plays a critical role in various biological processes. There is increasing evidence linking m6A modifications with various cancer phenotypes, highlighting the importance of m6A in cancer biology. Despite this, the roles of m6A modifying enzymes (writers, erasers, readers) and the reprogramming of m6A sites in cancer remain poorly understood. Our understanding of how m6A-mediated regulation of gene expression influences downstream cancer pathways and phenotypes is still limited.

To bridge these knowledge gaps, we have developed "m6A-Suite," a comprehensive suite of informatics tools designed to enhance the study of m6A modifications in cancer research. This project involves close collaboration with experts in cancer biology to uncover reprogrammed viral and host m6A epitranscriptomes in cells infected by the oncogenic virus KSHV. Our tools have also facilitated the discovery of interactions between m6A writers, erasers, and readers that regulate cancer growth and progression.

### Challenges Addressed:
The rapid advances in m6A and cancer research present several unmet informatics challenges:
- Precise identification of single-base m6A sites.
- Prediction of key regulatory mechanisms mediated by m6A from profiling data.
- Creation of a comprehensive database that details the "where," "what," and "how" of m6A methylation in both normal and cancer conditions.

## Aims of m6A-Suite:
1. **Tool Development for m6A Detection and Quantification:** Utilize a collection of 1,113 human and 680 mouse MeRIP-seq samples from various sources, along with identified over 4 million m6A peaks, to create high-quality training datasets for developing tools that can accurately detect and quantify single-base m6A sites from MeRIP-seq and nanopore data.
2. **Prediction of m6A-Mediated RNA Decay and Splicing:** Enable predictions that link m6A modifications to RNA decay and alternative splicing events, providing insights into the functional consequences of m6A modifications.
3. **Establishment of m6A-KB:** Develop a comprehensive and queriable knowledge base that catalogs m6A modifications and their predicted functions across a vast array of public MeRIP-seq and nanopore data in diverse cancer and normal conditions.

## Key Components:
- **m6A Degradation Tool:** Our m6A degradation tool provides a critical function by predicting the degradation rate of mRNA based on m6A modifications. This tool helps in understanding the stability and life cycle of mRNA in various cellular conditions. [(Explore m6A Degradation Tool)](https://github.com/Huang-AI4Medicine-Lab/m6A-BERT-Deg)
- **m6A Knowledge Graph:** The m6A Knowledge Graph is a visual representation that links m6A sites to their potential regulatory functions and interactions. This graph is an essential resource for researchers looking to understand the complex dynamics of m6A in cancer. [(Visit m6A Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/Huang-AI4Medicine-Lab/reguloGPT)

## Collaborations and Impact:
We will evaluate and refine these tools through systematic testing and collaborations both within and outside the ITCR consortium. The m6A-Suite tools and data will be made freely available to the research community to facilitate further research and development in the field. We are committed to continuously improving these tools based on feedback from collaborators and users.

This addition to the ITCR program is poised to significantly advance the rapidly evolving field of m6A research in cancer, addressing critical gaps and providing invaluable resources to the scientific community.
